# BBC-B
Pet project to learn about 6502 CPU, Rust and BBC micro computer

* ALU does binary `ADC`/`SBC`, shifts and rotates, bit wise Boolean, ...
* Addressing modes tested in original prototype
* Stack, register transfers, ...
* Branch, jump and subroutines
* `BRK` and rudimentary IRQ and NMI handling
* 6502 disassembler
* preliminary benchmark performance ~7e7 instructions / second
## todo
* Instruction execution puts PC increment in wrong place
* Missing all peripherals
* No timing or cycle counting whatsoever
* Memory is flat 64kB RAM --- Needs some way to add memory mapped I/O, maybe
  write protect ROM area, bank switching, ...
* has 10% of mos6522 for system VIA and rudiments of keyboard interface
* needs quick 'n' dirty frame buffer to see what's going on (do proper video
  ULA and 6845 later)
* OMG, [Toby Nelson](https://tobylobster.github.io/mos/mos/index.html)'s
  annotated MOS assembly is a treasure!

Hmmm. So far so good. Booting the OS 1.20 ROM and looking for signs of live in
(alleged) video area (`0x3000` - `0x7FFF`) yields only zeroes, except for a
mysterious 16 bytes:

```
00004880  7e 18 18 18 18 18 18 00  7e 18 18 18 18 18 18 00  |~.......~.......|
```

Emulating Mode 0, 3, or 4 monochrome graphics, this looks like `TT`:

Progress: after clearing the SHEILA page (all zeroes; RAM rather than mapped
devices), I'm seeing:

```

00008000
```

So it looks like we've landed in MODE 7, where the initialization loop detected
correct amount of memory, tried to set up devices and interrupt vectors but
fails to find the BASIC rom at 0x8000-0xC000. Which is fair, because it's not
loaded, yet.

Added interception of calls to `OSWRCH`, forwarding `A` register (character to
write) to standard out. No working keyboard yet, but this should simplify
interactive debugging and regression tests.

...And after adding stuffing the Basic ROM at `0x8000`, the `Language?` error disappears as well:

```
