# bbc-b
Pet project to learn about 6502 cpu, Rust and BBC micro computer

* ALU does binary `ADC`/`SBC`, shifts and rotates, bitwise booleanX
* Addressing modes tested in original prototype
## todo
* ALU does binary `ADC`, `SBC, shifts and rotates, bitwise boolean              
* Instruction excution puts PC increment in wrong place
* Missing all peripherals
* No timing or cycle counting whatsoever
* More unit test
* More integration test
